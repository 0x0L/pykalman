Kalman Filter
=============

:mod:`kalman` is a simple, easy-to-read, and easy-to-use library implementing
the Kalman Filter and its variations.  Features include,

* The Kalman Filter and the Kalman Smoother for state estimation
* Support for time-dependent state transition and observation parameters
* Support for offsets in state transitions and observations (great for robotics!)
* Support for missing observations
* An EM algorithm implementation where you can pick and choose which parameters to learn
* Dead simple, 3 method interface: :func:`em`, :func:`filter`, and :func:`smooth`
